The dashboard is dynamic by selecting any of the region up top you can directly drill into that particular region. If I select south region all my visual well transform to that region. You can only see the states for that region. Also, if you go to order details it displays that regionâ€™s information. If I drill further my states to Georgia are my visuals will match to that chosen state these are the ways my dashboard is interactive and dynamic. If I go to the order details it will show that selected region and state.
