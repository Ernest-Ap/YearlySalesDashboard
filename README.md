## Summary 

### In this report I analysed:

### Total Sales $26,455, Total Profit $244 and Total Orders 126. The Sales by Top 5 Sub-Categories in Florida their top selling product is phones $8,279. Florida has a small of profit of 2.8% the lowest profit in the south year of 2017. The Furniture category in Florida was the biggest loss with -$1,339 profit.

### Florida has to work on improving their furniture sales because this is where the most loss is from. My suggestions is to make more unique furniture to suit many types of customers. Also design new styles of furniture that takes inspiration from the sunny weather of the this state because Florida is one of the most unique states in the US.
